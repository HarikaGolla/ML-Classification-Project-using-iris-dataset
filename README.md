# ML-Classification-Project-using-iris-dataset
This project explores the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The primary goal was to build and compare three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict the species with high accuracy.
