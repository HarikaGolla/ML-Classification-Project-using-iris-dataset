# ML-Classification-Project-using-iris-dataset
This repository contains code and resources for exploring the famous Iris dataset and building machine learning models for species classification.

# Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples, each belonging to one of three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica). For this project, we aim to:

Explore and visualize the Iris dataset to gain insights into the data.

Build several machine learning models for classification:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

Evaluate model performance using accuracy score as the metric.

# Files
ML Project.ipynb: google colab containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

iris.csv : The dataset used for training and testing the models.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

# Dependencies
Python 3

Libraries used:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
seaborn
Usage

# Clone the repository:
